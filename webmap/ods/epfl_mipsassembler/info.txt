			  Freeware / Postcardware

MIPS Assembler is completely free! That is you may copy it as you want and redistribute it. Please do not upload it to a download software engine but use a link instead. MIPS Assembler is not yet open-source, that means I do not provide the source code. 

Would you be interested in MIPS Assembler as an open-source software? If so, please let me know why! 

What does "Postcardware" mean? I would be very glad to receive a postcard from where you live if you find this software really useful. Other user postcards are available here!

Thank you in advance!
